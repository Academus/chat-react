# Academus Chat Web

This is the next generation of Academus Chat for the web, built with modern web technology like TypeScript, React, and Redux. (The current Academus Chat web client was built with vanilla AngularJS.)

We are open sourcing this client so others can learn from it as well as contribute.

## Developing

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

Yep, ez.
